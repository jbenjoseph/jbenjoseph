👋

JJ is CEO and Founder of TensorSpace. See [my LinkedIn for my career history](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jj-ben-joseph-53743b113/). TensorSpace is developing a commercially useful artificial intelligence system with the ultimate goal of aiding the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). TensorSpace is also very active in the field of AI alignment and safety.

JJ is also working on another stealth startup in partnership with [AION Labs](https://aionlabs.com) based on TensorSpace technology applied to pharmacutical development.

I contribute to open source drug discovery and pandemic response projects that use artificial intelligence. I also have work on AI Goverence (and the subfields Alignment/Safety, Fairness, MLOps and DevSecOps).

I maintain the personal blog [🪬 Memories of Zion](https://www.memoriesofzion.com/), where I muse poetic at the confluence of artificial intelligence and Jewish history - sometimes connecting them in the same post.
