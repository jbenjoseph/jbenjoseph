JJ is CEO and Founder of TensorSpace. See [my LinkedIn for my career history](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jj-ben-joseph-53743b113/). TensorSpace is developing a commercially useful artificial intelligence system with the ultimate goal of aiding the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

On GitHub, mostly of my contributions are in drug discovery and pandemic response projects that use artificial intelligence. I have work on AI Goverence (and the subfields Alignment/Safety, Fairness, MLOps and DevSecOps).

I maintain the personal blog [ðŸª¬ Memories of Zion](https://www.memoriesofzion.com/), where I muse poetic at the confluence of artificial intelligence and Jewish history - sometimes connecting them in the same post.
