JJ is CEO of TensorSpace. See [my LinkedIn for my career history](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jj-ben-joseph-53743b113/). 

On GitHub, mostly of my contributions are in drug discovery and pandemic response projects that use artificial intelligence. I have also picked up AI Goverence (and the subfields AI Assurance, AI Alignment/Safety, AI Fairness, MLOps and DevSecOps) as a secondary interest, but I am still very much in the learning phase of that journey.

I maintain the personal blog [Memories of Zion](https://www.memoriesofzion.com/), where I muse poetic at the confluence of artificial intelligence and Jewish history (sometimes connecting them in the same post).
