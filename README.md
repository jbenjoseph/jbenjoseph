Artificial intelligence researcher and a strategic venture capitalist. See my LinkedIn for more info. 

On GitHub, mostly of my contributions are in drug discovery and pandemic response projects that use artificial intelligence. I have also picked up AI Assurance and DevSecOps as a secondary interest.
