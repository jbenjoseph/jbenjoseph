Old bio:

JJ Ben-Joseph (×™×•× ×ª×Ÿ ×™×”×•×“×” ×‘×Ÿ ×™×•×¡×£) is the founder and CEO of TensorSpace, a stealth-mode AI/ML startup. He's a computer scientist who saw the writing on the wall and pivoted into pandemic prevention well before COVID-19, becoming a venture capitalist focused on biosecurity. He's also one of the few people who thinks AI is profoundly underhyped (although that might have changed in 2022). 

Before starting his own company, JJ worked at the strategic venture capital firm In-Q-Tel, where he helped biosecurity and AI startups succeed with US government customers and worked on drug discovery and pandemic response technologies. He's a former fellow at the American Jewish Committee, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and the Foresight Institute. He's also a PhD candidate doing research on artificial intelligence and a dad to two amazing daughters.
