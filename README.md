Artificial intelligence researcher and a strategic venture capitalist. See my LinkedIn for more info. 

On GitHub, mostly of my contributions are in drug discovery and pandemic response projects that use artificial intelligence. I have also picked up AI Assurance (aka. AI Safety and/or AI Fairness) and DevSecOps (aka. SecDevOps) as a secondary interest, but I am still very much in the learning phase of that journey.
